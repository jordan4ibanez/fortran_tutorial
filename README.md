## Why Fortran?

If you browse my repositories on here, you will see I've been up and down the block when it comes to programming languages.
I started using modern Fortran just to see what it's like.

The approach was: "This language is so old this probably won't even compile on a modern machine. If it does it's probably terrible to use."

Needless to say, that was a very wrong assumption.

Modern Fortran is a very down to business language. It's a delight to use. You get a low level language with high level concepts. When you need to talk to C for things Fortran has no concept of (like file systems), it's easy. It also seems to be an **extremely** fast language to top it off.
